StoreVu was designed by Permanent Customer Connections (PCC), LLC to deliver digital advertising that pays. Since 2008, we’ve provided local businesses with all the necessary resources to measurably increase sales and profits through automated customer marketing. On average our clients continue to increase the size of their customer bases, while achieving promotional redemption rates in excess of 20%!


In 2020 we integrated our complete online ordering solution with our ReTexts text-based customer promotion solution.﻿

StoreVu is the only completely managed solution in the market, and typically provided at an expense less than or equal to the “do-it-yourself” options. Regardless, we can offer any local business a written guarantee that your profits will increase.
